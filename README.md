# React-firebase-course
NORMAL- When a request is sent to the server, server renders a HTML page to the browser and if any another request is made from that page(going to the link), ther server will render a new page for that request but in REACT- the server gives only one html page and REACT will just swap contents for other request made.
In the Banner func we write jsx which is converted by babble into old js(as browser doesnt understand jsx)give it to dom.
  1.there is no class in jsx but className
  2.There is only one parent tag in jsx
